# council-connect
This project will help the citizens of Austin participate in City Council decision making by providing notifications of upcoming agenda items and deadlines to sign up for public testimony. This will enable citizens to keep tabs on decision making so they can participate before decisions are finalized because Council information is currently too fragmented across different pages on the City's website.

We expect to have notifications for future items, the ability to search past items with suggested tags and a news feature combined in one app to make it easier for citizens to follow City Council events. Demo of basic functionality [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj6i6Tc5D_Q&feature=youtu.be).
